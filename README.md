## Fitness tracking with cutting-edge pose estimation and machine learning for precise monitoring and optimization of workouts, coupled with dietary planning and calorie calculation in a comprehensive web application.

<p>Traditional fitness tracking methods often rely on manual input, which can be imprecise and lead to suboptimal results, impacting the user's overall fitness journey. Our aim was to explore and develop a state-of-the art pose estimation system using Computer Vision and Machine Learning, to be used in the field of fitness. Our web application would also assist in maintaining dietary planning, exercising, calculating calories.</p>
